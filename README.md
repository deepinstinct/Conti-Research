# Conti-Research

This GitHub is part of the full Conti Research report.

Conti is one of the most notorious ransomware groups of our time, garnering fame and fortune while making enemies with anyone who tried to stop them.

In this research, we will take you on a journey through Conti’s milestones: its formation, most notable attacks, and the U.S. authorities’ attempts to hunt down the group’s members and disband it. We’ll also review Conti’s in-house struggles, its role in the Russia-Ukraine war, detail the release of some of its most sensitive documents, and describe the group’s steep fall from grace.

Full details of the research can be found on in the full report on www.deepinstinct.com
